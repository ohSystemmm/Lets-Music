## New Contributor Guide

To get familiar with the project, start by reading the README file. It provides an overview of the repository, its purpose, and how to set up your environment.

Getting Started

Review the project structure and existing codebase.

Check what types of contributions are accepted—some contributions don’t require coding!

## Issues

Creating a New Issue

Before opening a new issue, check if a similar issue already exists.

If not, open a new issue using the appropriate issue form.

Provide a clear and concise description, including steps to reproduce if applicable.

## Solving an Issue

Browse existing issues and use labels to filter them (see "Label Reference").

Issues are not assigned, so if you find one you'd like to work on, feel free to submit a PR with a fix.

If unsure about the implementation, discuss it in the issue before starting.
